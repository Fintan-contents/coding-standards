# JSP Style Guide

Here you will find coding conventions to help you code in JSP.
This coding convention is based on [JSP custom tags for the Nablarch Application Framework](https://nablarch.github.io/docs/LATEST/doc/en/application_framework/application_framework/libraries/tag.html). However, each convention includes a reason as to why the convention must be followed. The concept of the conventions is not dependent on Nablarch, so if you use other frameworks, please refer to the concept of each convention to create a coding convention that matches the framework you use.
